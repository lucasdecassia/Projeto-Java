# XYZ System - Phase 1 Requirements

## Use Case: Plant Management

### User Story

**As an** administrator or authorized user of the XYZ system,  
**I want to** create, update, search, and delete plant records,  
**So that** I can maintain an accurate database of plants that will serve as input for Phase 2.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system shall allow users to create new plant records with the following attributes:
   - Code (numeric, required, unique)
   - Description (alphanumeric, up to 10 characters, optional)

2. The system shall allow users to update existing plant records.

3. The system shall allow users to search for plants based on code or description.

4. The system shall allow only administrators to delete plant records.

5. The system shall prevent the creation of duplicate plant codes.

6. The system shall validate that plant codes contain only numeric characters.

7. The system shall validate that plant descriptions do not exceed 10 characters.

## Business Rules

1. **BR-01: Plant Code Uniqueness**
   - Each plant must have a unique code in the system.
   - If a user attempts to create a plant with an existing code, the system must reject the operation and display an appropriate error message.

2. **BR-02: Plant Code Format**
   - Plant codes must contain only numeric characters.
   - The system must validate this format during creation and updates.

3. **BR-03: Plant Description Length**
   - Plant descriptions must not exceed 10 characters.
   - If a description exceeds this limit, it must be truncated or rejected.

4. **BR-04: Deletion Authorization**
   - Only users with administrator privileges can delete plant records.
   - Non-administrator users attempting to delete plants should receive an "Unauthorized Operation" message.

5. **BR-05: Mandatory Fields**
   - Plant code is mandatory and cannot be null or empty.
   - Plant description is optional and can be null or empty.

## Validations and Security Measures

### Input Validation

1. **Plant Code Validation**
   - Validate that the code contains only numeric characters.
   - Validate that the code is not null or empty.
   - Validate that the code is unique in the system.

2. **Plant Description Validation**
   - Validate that the description does not exceed 10 characters.
   - If the description contains special characters, they should be properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

### Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
   - All operations must be performed by authenticated users.
   - The system must maintain an audit log of all create, update, and delete operations.

2. **Authorization**
   - The system must verify user roles before allowing delete operations.
   - Only users with the "Administrator" role can delete plant records.

3. **Data Protection**
   - All data transmissions should be encrypted using HTTPS.
   - Database access should be restricted to authorized application components only.

## Technical Implementation Considerations

1. **Data Layer**
   - Create a Plant entity with the following attributes:
     - id (internal identifier, not visible to users)
     - code (unique, numeric)
     - description (optional, max 10 characters)
     - createdBy (user who created the record)
     - createdDate (timestamp of creation)
     - lastModifiedBy (user who last modified the record)
     - lastModifiedDate (timestamp of last modification)

2. **Service Layer**
   - Implement validation logic for plant code and description.
   - Implement business rules for uniqueness and authorization.

3. **Controller Layer**
   - Implement REST endpoints for CRUD operations.
   - Implement proper error handling and response codes.

4. **UI Layer**
   - Create forms for plant creation and update.
   - Implement client-side validation for immediate feedback.
   - Display appropriate error messages for validation failures.

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing

1. **Service Layer Tests**
   - Test validation logic for plant code and description.
   - Test business rules for uniqueness and authorization.
   - Test edge cases such as null values, empty strings, and boundary conditions.

2. **Repository Layer Tests**
   - Test database operations for creating, updating, and deleting plants.
   - Test unique constraint enforcement.

### Integration Testing

1. **API Tests**
   - Test all REST endpoints for proper functionality.
   - Test authentication and authorization.
   - Test error handling and response codes.

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Boundary Conditions**
   - Creating a plant with a code at the maximum allowed value.
   - Creating a plant with a description exactly 10 characters long.
   - Creating a plant with a description more than 10 characters long (should be rejected or truncated).

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - Attempting to create a plant with a duplicate code.
   - Attempting to create a plant with non-numeric code.
   - Attempting to delete a plant as a non-administrator user.

3. **Concurrency**
   - Multiple users attempting to create plants with the same code simultaneously.
   - Multiple users attempting to update the same plant simultaneously.

## Sample Implementation

### Plant Entity

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "plants")
public class Plant {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @Column(unique = true, nullable = false)
    private String code;
    
    @Column(length = 10)
    private String description;
    
    @Column(name = "created_by")
    private String createdBy;
    
    @Column(name = "created_date")
    private LocalDateTime createdDate;
    
    @Column(name = "last_modified_by")
    private String lastModifiedBy;
    
    @Column(name = "last_modified_date")
    private LocalDateTime lastModifiedDate;
    
    // Getters and setters
}
```

### Plant Service

```java
@Service
public class PlantService {
    private final PlantRepository plantRepository;
    private final UserService userService;
    
    public PlantService(PlantRepository plantRepository, UserService userService) {
        this.plantRepository = plantRepository;
        this.userService = userService;
    }
    
    public Plant createPlant(Plant plant) {
        validatePlant(plant);
        
        if (plantRepository.existsByCode(plant.getCode())) {
            throw new DuplicateCodeException("A plant with this code already exists");
        }
        
        // Set audit information
        String currentUser = userService.getCurrentUsername();
        LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
        
        plant.setCreatedBy(currentUser);
        plant.setCreatedDate(now);
        plant.setLastModifiedBy(currentUser);
        plant.setLastModifiedDate(now);
        
        return plantRepository.save(plant);
    }
    
    public void deletePlant(String code) {
        if (!userService.isCurrentUserAdmin()) {
            throw new UnauthorizedException("Only administrators can delete plants");
        }
        
        Plant plant = plantRepository.findByCode(code)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Plant not found"));
        
        plantRepository.delete(plant);
    }
    
    private void validatePlant(Plant plant) {
        if (plant.getCode() == null || plant.getCode().isEmpty()) {
            throw new ValidationException("Plant code is required");
        }
        
        if (!plant.getCode().matches("\\d+")) {
            throw new ValidationException("Plant code must contain only numeric characters");
        }
        
        if (plant.getDescription() != null && plant.getDescription().length() > 10) {
            throw new ValidationException("Plant description cannot exceed 10 characters");
        }
    }
    
    // Other methods for updating and searching plants
}
```

## Conclusion

This document outlines the requirements, business rules, validations, and testing approach for the Plant Management functionality in Phase 1 of the XYZ system. By implementing these specifications, the system will provide a solid foundation for managing plant data that will serve as input for Phase 2.
